<OpeningParagraph>
  So in between my last post and this one, I realized that I wanted to create
  some tree animations to show some common tree operations and explain more
  gracefully how the minimax algorithm worked. Because I'm a react addict, I
  wanted a react component that could render easily animatable svg paths. After
  an admittedly short time googling this, I didn't come across any great
  options. One component,{" "}
  <Link href="https://github.com/bkrem/react-d3-tree">React d3 Tree</Link>, did
  do most of what I wanted, but I didn't really want to bring in d3 as a
  dependency for something so simple.
</OpeningParagraph>

Well, turns out it isn't so simple. Rendering a general tree is actually quite a difficult problem. More specifically, determining the x-coordinates for a particular node at a given depth in the tree is annoyingly nontrivial. The y-coordinates are just evenly spaced at a given depth separation value, so figuring them out is as simple as multiplying the depth of the node by the depth separation constant. To get an idea as to why this is, feel free to click around in the demo below. Clicking on a node will add a child. Note how adding a bunch of children in a different subtree can affect the subtrees to the left or right.

<TreeDemo />

## But there's hope!

Fortunately, I'm not the only person who has had this problem. After another quick google search I came across [this paper](http://www.cs.unc.edu/techreports/89-034.pdf), written by a UNC professor from my home state. It was written in 1989, well before I was born, but I figured trees hadn't really changed a whole lot since then so it should be alright. The paper describes an algorithm for finding the optimal aesthetic positioning of x-coordinates in a general n-ary tree (meaning a graph with one root, no cycles, and nodes with any number of children). The basic algorithm takes part in two steps:

1. Do a first-pass traversal of the tree and save preliminary x-coordinate values for each node
2. Do a second path and determine the final positions of the nodes.

Wow, super easy right? Wrong again. The algorithm itself is much more complicated and outside of the scope of this post. I'd rather focus on my implementation of it, because I think that is less boring and way easier to explain.

## Making the component

At my company, we use Flow, which is a type checker for javascript code. Essentially it is a superset of javascript that get's compiled down into code that can be run in the browser. It adds the ability to define types for variables and functions in your code, which catches a lot of errors that a browser won't catch because of the loosely-typed nature of js code. For this component, I decided to use Typescript, which is essentially the same thing as Flow, just better in every way. Okay so I'm opinionated, deal with it. I set up a basic create-react-app project with typescript and started by thinking about the shape of the component I was building. I wanted the ability to specify nodes as children of the `<Tree />` component, but this quickly becomes verbose for large trees, so I also wanted the ability to specify a data structure.

I intially settled on supporting both approaches - if there are children then they are rendered, otherwise a `vertices` prop is required which the component uses to render the positioned nodes. For example, using the children API, you could render a tree like this:

```js
// jsx
<Tree rootId={0}>
  <Node id={0} children={[1, 2, 3]} />
  <Node id={1} />
  <Node id={2} />
  <Node id={3} />
</Tree>
```

Where `<Node />` would be a component exposed by the library that essentially rendered an svg `<circle/>`. With the `vertices` prop API, you could render the tree like this:

```js
// jsx
const vertices = new Map([
  [0, [1, 2, 3]],
  [1, []],
  [2, []],
  [3, []],
]);

<Tree rootId={0} vertices={vertices} />;
```

I thought that this would make for a pretty flexible component, but I quickly ran into issues. For example, in one of the posts I was working on, I wanted to make a visualization of an depth first search using this component. Essentially all of the nodes would be grayed out initially and then once they were visited they would change to a brighter color. This seemed like a simple thing to do, but it quickly became extremely messy. Every node had to have a check to test whether or not it had been visited, and my render function became incredibly hard to read. Also, I was having to iterate over the children and essentially construct the same map that the vertex prop was giving me, so the children API was just a more verbose and slightly more customizable way of presenting the same data.

## Having my Cake and Eating it too

So what was the solution? After giving it some more thought, this seemed like the perfect component for using the function-as-child approach. Essentially, the `<Tree />` component would accept a function as its child, and that function would be called to render each of the nodes in the tree. For example:

```js
// jsx
const vertices = new Map([
  [0, [1, 2, 3]],
  [1, []],
  [2, []],
  [3, []],
]);

<Tree rootId={0} vertices={vertices}>
  {({ x, y, id }) => <circle cx={x} cy={y} r={5} />}
</Tree>;
```

Now, conditionally rendering the color of the node would just involve adding a fill prop to the `<circle />` component and either rending gray or blue based on whether the node's id was in the visited set. The child is also passed in the entire `TreeMap` object, which contains the calculated positions of all this nodes. This allows for the arbitrary rendering of the tree, if you have enough imagination. For example, you could add an arrow showing the direction of a traversal, or modify a node's position based on the position of its neighbor.

The final API looks like this:

```js
// jsx
const vertices = new Map([
  [0, [1, 2, 3]],
  [1, []],
  [2, []],
  [3, []],
]);

return (
  <Tree width={200} height={40} rootId={0} nodeSize={5} vertices={vertexMap}>
    {({ x, y, id }) => (
      <g>
        <circle cx={x} cy={y} r={5} fill="rgb(15, 98, 189)" />
        <TextLabel x={x} y={y} label={id} />
      </g>
    )}
  </Tree>
);
```

## Implementation

The component renders an svg, so the render method is wrapped in an `svg` tag. The children of the svg are rendered in a separate function to keep the render method clean. This function, `renderTree`, creates a `TreeGraph`, which is a helper class I created that conatins all of the operations necessary for the algorithm described in the referenced paper. Once this obejct is created, the function `positionTree` is called, which actually runs the positioning algorithm and stores the resulting information in the `TreeGraph` object. This information is then used to actually render the nodes and their connections in `renderFromVertexMap`:

```js
// jsx
renderFromVertexMap = (treeGraph: TreeGraph): Array<React.ReactNode> | null => {
  const { vertices, children } = this.props;
  if (!vertices) return null;

  const svgElements: Array<React.ReactNode> = [];
  vertices.forEach((childNodes: Array<TreeNode>, node: TreeNode) => {
    // Get the final position of the node after the algorithm has been run
    const [x, y] = treeGraph.getCoordinates(node);
    // Create a node using the function-as-child. Note that we also pass in
    // the entire treeGraph as a parameter as an escape hatch to render arbitrary
    // svg elements based on the final positions of the nodes
    const createdNode = children({
      x,
      y,
      id: node,
      r: this.nodeSizeMap.get(node) || DEFAULT_NODE_SIZE,
      graph: treeGraph,
    });
    // First we push the line between a node and it's children, because of the
    // way svg layer ordering works
    svgElements.push(this.createChildConnections(treeGraph, node, childNodes));
    // Then we push the node
    svgElements.push(createdNode);
  });

  return svgElements;
};
```

The array of svg nodes is then returned from `renderTree` and becomes the children of the root `svg` element. The complete `<Tree />` component definition is shown below:

```js
// jsx
import * as React from "react";

import TreeGraph, { TreeNode, Position } from "./helpers/TreeGraph";

    if (!vertices) return null;
    const svgElements: Array<React.ReactNode> = [];

      svgElements.push(

    return svgElements;

    ];
    const treeGraph = new TreeGraph(
      this.props.vertices,
      this.nodeSizeMap,
      rootPosition
    );
    const res = positionTree(treeGraph, rootPosition[0], {

    });
    if (!res && this.props.onError)
      this.props.onError("Tree could not be rendered in the viewing rect");
    return res ? treeGraph : null;
  };

  /**

  get nodeSizeMap(): Map<TreeNode, number> {

  vertices={
    new Map([
      [0, [1, 2, 3]],
      [1, []],
      [2, []],
      [3, []],
    ])
  }

    <g>
      <circle cx={x} cy={y} r={5} fill="rgb(15, 98, 189)" />
      <TextLabel x={x} y={y} label={id} />
    </g>
  )}
</Tree>

## Documenting the component

> You can have the coolest component in the world, but if there isn't any documentation no one is going to use it - Confucious, probably.

I love the idea of code as a living source of documentation, so when I saw [docz](https://www.docz.site/), it seemed like the perfect place to start. Docz allows you to display your components using [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx), a document format that allows you to write markdown and render React components inline. The main component the package exposes is called `Playground`, which both renders any component that is passed in as a child and displays the markup for that component. For example:

![Docz](/static/minimax-continued/docz.png "Example of docz playground component")

They also provide a component called `<PropsTable />` that renders a table of the component's props without you really having to do anything. Setting it up was as simple as running `yarn add docz docz-theme-default` and aliasing `yarn docz:start` to `docz dev`. Add a file with a `.mdx` extension anywhere in the project and viola - you now have component docs!

Docz was so good that I actually deleted my webpack-dev-server and just used it's hot-reloading environment for development. Moving forward I'm definitely going to use it in all of my projects. Once my component was documented, I ran `yarn add --dev gh-pages` and added the following lines to my `package.json`:

```json
// json
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "docz:build": "docz build",
    "deploy": "yarn docz:build && gh-pages -d .docz/dist"
  }
```

Running this command builds a prod version of the docz pages, and then the `gh-pages` package checks out the build directory into the `gh-pages` branch of the repo, which github automatically deploys to `http://[username].github.io/[repo-name]`.

## Publishing the package

I'm not super experienced with webpack, so it took me a while to get builds to work properly. One important gotcha is that you should always specify `react` and `react-dom` as externals so that they don't get bundled into your code, as they will always be available:

```js
// js
// webpack.config.js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  mode: 'production',
  ...
  externals: {
    // Don't bundle react or react-dom
    react: {
      commonjs: 'react',
      commonjs2: 'react',
      amd: 'React',
      root: 'React',
    },
    'react-dom': {
      commonjs: 'react-dom',
      commonjs2: 'react-dom',
      amd: 'ReactDOM',
      root: 'ReactDOM',
    },
  },
};
```

You also need to specify them as peer-dependencies in your `package.json`:

```json
// json
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "^16.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^16.2.0"
  },
```

Another annoying issue as that umd bundling doesn't work like you would expect with webpack. I was trying to render the component on this blog, which uses [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to server-render react. But every time I imported the bundle it would give me an error saying that window was not defined. This was because the package was being attached to the window object for loading in a browser environment, but the window object does not exist on the server, where the page is initially rendered. To get around this, I needed to add the following to my output config:

```js
// js
  "output": {
    ...
    libraryTarget: 'umd',
    globalObject: 'this',
  }
```

Then everything worked as expected in both the server and browser environments. After getting builds to work it was as simple as ignoring files I didn't want to include in my `.npmignore` and specifying `"main": "dist/index.js"` in my `package.json`. Running `yarn publish` allowed me to publish the package under `react-svg-tree`. With that, I had a 19 KiB react component published on npm for rendering a general n-ary tree. Phew. The component will most likely be used heavily in my future posts. Speaking on which, I need to get on that.
