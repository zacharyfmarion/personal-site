  Welcome to my blog! I've been meaning to create one for a while, and finally
  got around to actually doing it! In case you were wondering, it was made using
  Ghost, a wonderful open source blogging platform. I hosted it on a
  DigitalOcean droplet, created a subdomain, and voila! A blog for $5 a month.

As far as content goes, this will probably be a place for all of my ponderings and ideas. Primarily I am a web developer, so I can see myself posting about React components or webpack techniques that I find interesting and useful. I have also started getting into machine learning as a hobby, so I might post some explanations to algorithms or network architectures as it will help me learn them myself. I hope you enjoy!

**EDIT**: I recently started a post where I wanted to use a react component that I had built, but Ghost doesn't really let you use react components unless you want to be extra hacky. I got frustrated and decided to make my own blog from scratch, using [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [MDX](). I started trying to dockerize the app and deploy it myself but I got a bunch of errors, raged, and then just used Heroku. Typical developer workflow. Anyways, so far I'm loving it - I'll probably write a post about the transition shortly.
